On the way I asked if anyone knew, like the snowshoeing in the
Be mountains. But one shook only the head and meant, with such
Weather was not to think of the mountains.

When I approached the Sverresteig and it did not look like when
if it got better, I thought it might be
more sensible to reverse and the way over Gudvangen and from there
to hit the Larchal. From there I could on the post road
get ahead, then the weather may be as it should.

Thought, done. And since I also have a horse dealer with horse and
Sled, who wanted to go to Ostland on the same way and met
offered to take the snowshoes, so everything went in the most beautiful
Order.

In the evening I reached Vinje. Here was already good snowshoeing, only
it was a bit too mild. The man with the snowshoes and still
a horse trader who had joined stayed overnight
the neighboring farm. They promised to audition before me
set off next morning.

After the unfamiliar movement, I slept well. The day was beautiful
pretty far advanced when I woke up. I straightened up,
to look through the window. But what a sight: ice flowers
the windows! It was impossible to see through it. I was in a hurry
on and by rubbing and puffing, I thawed so much of the window,
that I could see: it was clear frosty weather with fresh snow. The
gave a jubilation ...

Hastily I ate breakfast, and then I jumped for the
Neighbor yard over to get the snowshoes; now it should be after
Gudvangen go. But alas, the men were half an hour ago
gone and took the snowshoes.
